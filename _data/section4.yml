<p>Wu's method provides the potential to prove geometric theorems that had not been proven before. It's impressive that this method has verified more than 500 theorems within a year, which would have required a lot of intelligence and time.</p>"

Within this context, information retrieval is a challenge for any document collection, especially for the Web which requires precision. It involves the process of searching within a document collection for specific information.</p>
    <p>Explore my project centered around the 'Google PageRank Algorithm' a profound exploration of how web search engines determine webpage rankings. Unveil the magic behind this algorithm, which draws upon concepts from linear algebra, including the impactful Perron-Frobenius Theorem.</p>"
